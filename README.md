# Neutron
A collection of websites and hosts that are known to create, spead, promote, or at minimum- allow falsehoods and conspiracy theories.

## Purpose
The goal of these lists is to limit my own, and my aging parents' exposure to sites and streaming platforms that willfully and regularly spread clickbait, hoaxes, propaganda and disinformation.

There exist a number of other lists that deal with similar topics and sites, though my intention with this it to take it a step further. These lists enable blocking some CDN domains that enable distribution of the aformentioned topics. These will be periodically updated.

## Usage
These files are formatted as standard [hosts files](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hosts_(file)), so you can simply append it to your current hosts file. I recommend using it with [@StevenBlackâ€™s hosts tool](https://github.com/StevenBlack/hosts), which lets you build a robust hosts file from a variety of frequently updated sources.

Where to find your hosts file:
- Mac OS, Linux: `/etc/hosts`
- Windows: `%SystemRoot%\system32\drivers\etc\hosts`
